*difficulty is for short name or full name of difficulties
	 "future" "ftr" "2" are acceptable

**use keyword s="xxx" can specify a user by a secret id , secret id can be generated by /utils/auth.py [see Generate a secret id]
```

## Generate a secret id

First of all , you should set an `auth` environmental variable , which should be the same as the one to be deployed to vercel

Then head to `utils` folder and run 

```bash
$ python3 auth.py # or python auth.py
```

input the usercode and it will return a secret id like this:

```
input your id > 000000001
Secret Id : 562f86d6fe0ce87b81ebc281ff826794
Secret Id decrypted : 000000001
```

## Deploy to vercel

Fork this repository and import it from [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Set `FRAMEWORK PRESET` to `Other`

Add `Environment Variables`

```
host = "xxxxxx" # for ArcaeaUnlimitedApi
token = "xxxxxx" # for ArcaeaUnlimitedApi
usercode = "xxxxxx" # default query user
auth = "xxxxxx" # a DES key for auth
timezone = "xxxxxx" # [optional] Asia/Shanghai for default
```

Click `Deploy `and wait for building
